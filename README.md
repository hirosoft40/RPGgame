## Features
I have implemented few things so that a game beginner like myself can enjoy also.
<ol>
<h3><li> Gem Mountain</li></h3>
<p>Users mind changes. Sometimes they want to play games, sometimes they are tired of attacking. So, I have created gem Mountain to play a very simple game. </p>

<h3><li> Anime style emotions </li></h3>
<p>I have added Anime style emotions so that users can enjoy more without reading letters.</p>

<h3><li> Error Handlings </li></h3>
<p>This game prompt user inputs. Therefore I spent more time on coding error handling.</p>

</ol>

## My Challenge
I am not a game person. So my biggest challenge was to learn more about how RPG game works. I interviewed few family members and then I was able to come up with specifications.
