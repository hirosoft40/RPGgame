# RPG GAME - COMMAND LINE
Terminal Based Python RPG Game made for DC class.

## Characters

This is a console-based, active-record-backed simple text-based role playing game. It was my first try at figuring out how to deal with modeling interactive fiction in a program, and it's still very much so a work in progress. This later was re-vamped as Dragon Blaster, but I hope to return to this when I have some time and make it the awesome game it deserves to be!

## How to play:
1. If you don't have python3 (If you have Python3, skip this.)
download python 3 for your OS.
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure your dependencies are all there.

2. Clone this repo to your local machine.
